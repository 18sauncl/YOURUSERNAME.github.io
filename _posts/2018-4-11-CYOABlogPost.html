    <h1>A Challange</h1>
    <p> I was unable to follow through with my initial idea for the game because it was too time consuming. However, I was able to come up with a new idea and follow it through!  </p>

    <h2>Something I'm Proud Of</h2>
    <p>I like my game because it goes through all the months of the year, and the player gets to learn something about each Zodiac sign!</p>
    
    <h3>How to Extend My Game</h3>
    <p>There are many ways that I could extend my game. A simple way would be to add photos and different colored fonts. I could also add more facts about the Zodiacs and the stars throughout the year.</p>
